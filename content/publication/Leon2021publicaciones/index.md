abstract: "Assessment plays a key role in learning processes in educational environments. Thus, active evaluations, such as self-evaluation, are being used increasingly frequently as a supplement to traditional evaluations due to their proven formative value. The present study analyzes the impact of the evaluations made by the students on the experience acquired by these students when they are subjected to evaluation situations and when they receive feedback from the teacher on these evaluations. To this end, two natural class groups carried out evaluations of the work done by other groups and of their own work. The difference between the groups was that one group received feedback from the teacher after the assessment and the other group did not. The results were analyzed to determine the groups’ accuracy in evaluating their peers and themselves with respect to the teacher’s evaluation. The data showed that both groups improved the accuracy of the evaluations throughout the sessions, with a significantly greater improvement for the group that received feedback. These results highlight the importance of evaluation in the learning process and the need to provide students with feedback on their evaluation."
