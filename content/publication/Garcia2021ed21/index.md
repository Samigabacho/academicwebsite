abstract: University  students  face  many  challenges  that  affect  their  mental  health during this stage. Psychosocial aspects, such as resilience, help to address the imbalance they often experience in their daily lives. The aim is  to  find  the  relationship  between  students’  resilience  and  their  mental  health,  while  analyzing  the  mediating  role  played  by  personality  factors  between these variables. To carry out this study, a sample of 692 university students  belonging  to  different  Degrees  of  Education  answered  three  questionnaires  voluntarily,  one  to  measure  resilience  (RS-14),  another  to measure personality factors (Big Five) and another to measure mental health  (MH-5).  A  mediational  model  based  on  Structural  Equations  was  proposed  for  this  analysis.The  results  indicate  that  resilience  is  able  to significantly predict students’ mental health directly and that it also predicts all personality components assessed in students. Furthermore, it was found that of all the personality factors examined, only neuroticism was found to be predictive of mental health. Furthermore, resilience is positioned as a mediating factor between mental health and personality factors. Specifically, resilience  emerged  as  a  significant  mediator  in  the  relationship  between  agreeableness, neuroticism and openness and mental health. Moreover, all other personality factors are directly related to resilience. In the same way, the results also confirm the need to train pre-service teachers in psychosocial factors in order to prevent future problems in their subsequent professional performance.
